          <p>
            Opportunities for challenging hikes and pleasant strolls are
            scattered all over this planet; you just need to know where to find
            them. We do. Kilimanjaro, Everest Base Camp, Patagonia, and the Inca
            Trail are out there, waiting for you to walk all over them. We’re
            proud of our record of successful ascents (over 92% of our
            travellers make it to the top of Kili, depending on the route), but
            it’s our CEOs and local guides that make the journey itself as
            memorable as the summit. And if you’re not into big climbs, don’t
            sweat it; we’ve got loads of lower-impact walks and iconic treks
            you’ll love, too.

              to our customized travel experiences and personalized service keep
              us smiling all day long. Here is just a sampling of what they’ve
              said:

                She has booked two major European trips for us in the past year
                and every aspect has met, and in most cases exceeded, our
                expectations. Best prices, best hotels, best itineraries, and
                best cruises, she does it all. But the most important thing is
                she remembers the little things that we would do if we were
                making the plans ourselves.

                Leigh McAdam has been making my travel arrangements for about 20
                years and there is no one else I would trust to arrange my trips
                and tours. I've also had great fun on a few of the group trips
                she has arranged - Peru & Machu Picchu and a 10-day cruise out
                of Venice and diving. It's always an eclectic group of well
                traveled, interesting people.
